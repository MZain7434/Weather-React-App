# React Weather Forecast App

This is a weather forecast app built using React JS and Open Weather Map API. The app allows users to search for weather information for any city and switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units. The app also includes a button to get the user's location and display the weather information accordingly.

I have explored the following things in this project  
* React.js: I used React.js to create a modular and efficient front-end that can handle complex state management and dynamic data rendering.
* Tailwind CSS: I leveraged Tailwind CSS to easily customize and style the app's components, layout, and typography.
* Open Weather Map API: I integrated two versions of Open Weather Map API - one call 3.0 and weather by city 2.5 - to fetch real-time weather data and display it in a user-friendly way. With these APIs, I was able to access information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
